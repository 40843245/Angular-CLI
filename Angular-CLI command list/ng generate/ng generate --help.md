ng generate --help

```
Generates and/or modifies files based on a schematic.

Commands:
  ng generate <schematic>              Run the provided schematic.                                             [default]
  ng generate app-shell                Configures your project to generate an app-shell during build time.
  ng generate application [name]       Generates a new Angular application within your workspace. This schematic sets up
                                       the foundational structure of your project, including the root component, module,
                                       and configuration files. You can customize various aspects of the application,
                                       such as routing, styling, and testing.                             [aliases: app]
  ng generate class [name]             Creates a new class in your project. Classes are the fundamental building blocks
                                       for object-oriented programming in TypeScript. They provide a blueprint for
                                       creating objects with properties and methods. This schematic helps you generate a
                                       new class with the basic structure and optional test files.         [aliases: cl]
  ng generate component [name]         Creates a new Angular component. Components are the basic building blocks of
                                       Angular applications. Each component consists of a TypeScript class, an HTML
                                       template, and an optional CSS stylesheet. Use this schematic to generate a new
                                       component in your project.                                           [aliases: c]
  ng generate config [type]            Generates configuration files for your project. These files control various
                                       aspects of your project's build process, testing, and browser compatibility. This
                                       schematic helps you create or update essential configuration files with ease.
  ng generate directive [name]         Creates a new directive in your project. Directives are used to extend the
                                       behavior or appearance of HTML elements and components. They allow you to
                                       manipulate the DOM, add custom attributes, and respond to events. This schematic
                                       generates the necessary files and boilerplate code for a new directive.
                                                                                                            [aliases: d]
  ng generate enum [name]              Creates a new enum in your project. Enums (enumerations) are a way to define a
                                       set of named constants, making your code more readable and maintainable. This
                                       schematic generates a new enum with the specified name and type.     [aliases: e]
  ng generate environments             Generates and configures environment files for your project. Environment files
                                       allow you to define different settings and configurations for various
                                       environments, such as development, testing, and production. This schematic helps
                                       you create and manage these files, making it easier to customize your
                                       application's behavior for each environment.
  ng generate guard [name]             Creates a new route guard in your project. Route guards are used to control
                                       access to parts of your application by checking certain conditions before a route
                                       is activated. This schematic generates a new guard with the specified name, type,
                                       and options.                                                         [aliases: g]
  ng generate interceptor [name]       Creates a new interceptor in your project. Interceptors are used to intercept and
                                       modify HTTP requests and responses before they reach their destination. This
                                       allows you to perform tasks like adding authentication headers, handling errors,
                                       or logging requests. This schematic generates the necessary files and boilerplate
                                       code for a new interceptor.
  ng generate interface [name] [type]  Creates a new interface in your project. Interfaces define the structure of
                                       objects in TypeScript, ensuring type safety and code clarity. This schematic
                                       generates a new interface with the specified name and type.          [aliases: i]
  ng generate library [name]           Creates a new library project in your Angular workspace. Libraries are reusable
                                       collections of components, services, and other Angular artifacts that can be
                                       shared across multiple applications. This schematic simplifies the process of
                                       generating a new library with the necessary files and configurations.
                                                                                                          [aliases: lib]
  ng generate module [name]            Creates a new, generic NgModule definition in the given project.     [aliases: m]
  ng generate pipe [name]              Creates a new pipe in your project. Pipes are used to transform data for display
                                       in templates. They take input values and apply a specific transformation, such as
                                       formatting dates, currency, or filtering arrays. This schematic generates the
                                       necessary files and boilerplate code for a new pipe.                 [aliases: p]
  ng generate resolver [name]          Creates a new resolver in your project. Resolvers are used to pre-fetch data
                                       before a route is activated, ensuring that the necessary data is available before
                                       the component is displayed. This can improve the user experience by preventing
                                       delays and loading states. This schematic generates a new resolver with the
                                       specified name and options.                                          [aliases: r]
  ng generate service [name]           Creates a new service in your project. Services are used to encapsulate reusable
                                       logic, such as data access, API calls, or utility functions. This schematic
                                       simplifies the process of generating a new service with the necessary files and
                                       boilerplate code.                                                    [aliases: s]
  ng generate service-worker           Adds a service worker to your project. Service workers enable your application to
                                       work offline or on low-quality networks by caching assets and intercepting
                                       network requests. This schematic configures your project to use a service worker.
  ng generate web-worker [name]        Creates a new web worker in your project. Web workers allow you to run JavaScript
                                       code in the background, improving the performance and responsiveness of your
                                       application by offloading computationally intensive tasks. This schematic
                                       generates the necessary files for a new web worker and provides an optional code
                                       snippet to demonstrate its usage.

Arguments:
  schematic  The [collection:schematic] to run.                                                                 [string]

Options:
      --help         Shows a help message for this command in the console.                                     [boolean]
      --interactive  Enable interactive input prompts.                                         [boolean] [default: true]
  -d, --dry-run      Run through and reports activity without writing out results.            [boolean] [default: false]
      --defaults     Disable interactive input prompts for options with a default.            [boolean] [default: false]
      --force        Force overwriting of existing files.                                     [boolean] [default: false]
